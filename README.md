# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

This repository contains code for predicting customer churn and performing exploratory analysis on customer data.

## Overview

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. Predicting and understanding churn is crucial for businesses as it helps in identifying at-risk customers and devising strategies to retain them. This project aims to build a classification model to predict customer churn and gain insights into factors influencing churn.

## Steps

### Step 1: Clean and Preprocess the Data

Ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.

- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale numerical features if needed

### Step 2: Exploratory Analysis

Explore the dataset to gain insights.

- Explore distribution of the target variable
- Visualize the relationship between features and churn
- Analyze correlations

### Step 3: Build a Classification Model

Construct a classification model to predict churn.

- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Fit a logistic regression model

### Step 4: Summary of Factors Influencing Churn and Preventive Actions

Summarize the factors influencing churn and suggest preventive actions.

- Analyze feature importance
- Provide actionable insights based on analysis
